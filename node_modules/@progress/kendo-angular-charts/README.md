## Key Features

Among the many features which the Kendo UI for Angular Charts deliver are:

* [Chart series types](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-angular-ui/components/charts/series-types/)&mdash;The Charts support a wide range of series types such as Categorical, Scatter, Circular, Funnel, and Scatter.
* [Data binding](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-angular-ui/components/charts/chart/data-binding/)&mdash;The Charts support the binding of their data series to arrays, arrays of arrays, objects, and observables. Beyond the actual series, other areas of the Chart, like the axis and labels, can all be bound to your data as well.
* [Rendering modes](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-angular-ui/components/charts/chart/rendering/)&mdash;The Charts support two modes for rendering—Canvas (bitmap) and SVG (vector graphics). By default, the Charts are rendered through SVG. Switching between the two is as easy as updating a single configuration option.
* [Export options](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-angular-ui/components/charts/chart/export-options/)&mdash;The Charts provide built-in support to save your Charts as an Image (PNG), PDF, SVG&mdash;without the need for server-side helpers.
* [Panning and zooming](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-angular-ui/components/charts/chart/pan-zoom/)&mdash;The Charts allow the user to interact with them by utilizing intuitive panning and zooming interactions. These functions can be easily enabled or disabled by setting the Chart options.
* [Appearance](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-angular-ui/components/charts/chart/styling/)&mdash;The colors of the Charts are normally picked up by the current Kendo UI theme, but each aspect of the Chart can be customized by theme variables or configuration options. Kendo UI for Angular delivers a set of popular themes including Bootstrap and Material, all of which can be easily customized with the [Progress ThemeBuilder online utility](https://themebuilder.telerik.com/kendo-angular-ui).
* [Globalization](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-angular-ui/components/charts/globalization/)&mdash;The Kendo UI for Angular Charts support globalization and localization to ensure that the each Chart component can fit in any application, no matter what languages and locales need to be supported.
